 Description:  This is a simple app that I was able to make in about a couple hours.
	       I used assets from a content creator on Udemy.com.  I learned a few
               useful things from this particular app, including:
		-How to create and nest layouts, including linear and constrained layouts
		-How to use the strings.xml file to create and add text to a button
		-How to build a random number generator in Java
		-How to create an on-click listener to create two random numbers and display
                 corresponding dice values.
